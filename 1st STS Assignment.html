        <h3 style="text-align: center;"> Who Is A Poor Person</h3>

            <p style="text-align: center;"> 
                A poor person is an individual who does not have the provisions 
                or financial capabilities to fulfill the minimum essential necessities 
                of life. In many countries in the world that allows an individual to 
                have fair court even if they do not have enough financial savings.

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Many People Do Not Know How To Commit Over 50% Of Income To Investments?</h3>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
                Passive income should be doubled from last time.  
                The poor do not realize that one million a year, 
                is not a big deal. Making 1 million a year is just 
                a matter of zeros. All you need to do is ask yourself 
                what are the passive incomes I can make. How can I 
                make it? Sit down, right? 20 passive things you can do 
                and you will be amazed that instead of you waiting on 
                your employer to employ you, you will be making millions 
                already.

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">The Poor Borrows Money That Does Not Go Towards Making More</h3>
            <p style="text-align: center;"> Poor people borrow money to buy flashy things like furniture, 
                cars, latest phones, to marry and other expensive things. There are systems that allow 
                people to borrow things for years and before they are done paying for the goods the product 
                has already been spoiled, the cloths are gone, the furniture are broken and many more.

            </p>
        
        
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">The wealthy invest in durable things.  </h3>

            <p style="text-align: center;">The wealthy hire best the professionals to make them rich, the poor hire anyone available. 
                When the poor is having a legal problem, they hire anyone available; they are looking for 
                a friend who did not even finished well. The wealthy hire the best professionals to argue 
                their case to put their matter together, to teach them how to manage their finances. When 
                you hire cheap you pay, when you pay cheap you hire monkeys.
